# Weather App - Node.js Project

*  As part of learning I created Weather web-app.
*  The weather data is gained by working with 'weatherstack.com' and 'mapbox.com' API's 
*  This project was done working with handlers, http requests and express.js.
*  Modules used: hbs,requests,express,nodemon.
*  You can run the code on your local machine using: `npm run dev`

 Web app is deployed on Heroku: https://weather-app-ir.herokuapp.com/
